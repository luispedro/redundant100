## Basic

1. Sort the input by
    - sequence size
    - sequence content
    - header

    GENERATED: {INPUT}.sorted.fna

2. Remove repeats.

    After sorting they are contiguous, so can be done in a single pass

    GENERATED: exact100.filtered.fna

3. Split by sizes

    This is mostly to be able to parallelize the next step

    GENERATED: splits/block.*.fna

4. Rolling hash filter

    GENERATED: copies/#_self & copies/#_##

5. Collect duplicates

    GENERATED: duplicates/#.txt

6. Remove duplicates

    Per block, remove all genes which were found to be duplicates

    GENERATED: cleaned/block.#.fna

7. Concatenate blocks

    GENERATED final.fna

## FILE FORMAT
